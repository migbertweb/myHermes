# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Migrated to the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.0.0, spec 2026-07-28).
- The stdio server is now dual-era: legacy and 2026-07-28 clients are served from the same process, selected per connection. No latency change for existing clients (see https://mcpvault.org/benchmarks).

### Added
- Protocol matrix tests covering both protocol eras.
- `benchmarks/` scripts comparing MCP v1 and MCP v2 latency.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- New `--read-only` CLI mode exposes only the 11 non-mutating tools and rejects direct calls to all vault mutations. Supports bare, spaced boolean, and `--read-only=true|false` forms for MCP client configuration compatibility ([#112](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/112), [#113](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/113), thanks @vdhome-dev)

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-08

### Security
- Dotfiles and hidden directories are now denied at any vault depth, closing an extension-filter bypass that allowed paths such as `.env`, `.bashrc`, and `.hidden.md` through note tools ([#115](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/115), thanks @sadegh)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- New `get_note_outline` tool returns headings with levels and line numbers without loading a full note, and ignores headings inside YAML frontmatter and CommonMark fenced code blocks ([#146](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/146), thanks @kartik7704)
- New `read_note_lines` tool reads an inclusive line range for targeted access to large notes while enforcing the same path security boundaries as `read_note` ([#146](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/146), thanks @kartik7704)

## [0.12.6] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- Refreshed the MCP SDK, YAML parser, and development toolchain dependencies; standardized the server package on npm and removed the stale root Bun lockfile ([#178](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/178))

## [0.12.5] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- The stdio server now exits cleanly when its client disconnects or sends `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, preventing orphaned MCPVault processes ([#159](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/159))

## [0.12.4] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- `wiki_link` now resolves path-qualified links like `[[folder/Note]]` (which Obsidian produces when a basename is ambiguous) by matching the full vault-relative path instead of only the basename

## [0.12.3] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- New `wiki_link` tool reads Obsidian wiki links: `[[Document Name]]`, `[[Document Name|Display Text]]`, table-authored escapes like `[[Document Name\|Display]]`, and `#fragment` suffixes. Returns the note content plus `structuredContent` with the resolved path and any alternative matches ([#101](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/101), thanks @renoirb)

### Changed
- `.trash/` (Obsidian's local trash) is now excluded from all tools via the default path filter ([#101](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/101))

## [0.12.2] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- `patch_note` no longer corrupts insertions containing `$` replacement patterns (`$'`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$$`); `newString` is now inserted literally ([#149](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/149), [#153](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/153))
- Paths that accidentally include the vault prefix (absolute or `~/`-style) are now normalized to vault-relative before resolution ([#122](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/122), [#151](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/151), thanks @grushikhin)

### Security
- Cleared npm audit high-severity findings via lockfile-only dependency updates; CI audit gate green again ([#154](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/154))

### Changed
- Dependency updates: `@types/node`, `tsx`, `vitest` minors ([#150](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/150)); `actions/setup-node` 7 ([#152](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/152))

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-23

### Security
- Frontmatter parsing no longer uses `js-yaml` 3.x (pinned by `gray-matter`, affected by the CVE-2023-44270 quadratic-complexity DoS); gray-matter's engine is overridden with the `yaml` package already used elsewhere. YAML 1.2 semantics: dates stay strings, single-letter keys like `y`/`n` stay strings

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `search_notes` now accepts optional `pathPrefix` (restrict the search to a vault subtree) and `excludePaths` (skip given subtrees). Filtering runs before file I/O, so excluded files are not read or scored and the result limit is no longer diluted by unwanted directories ([#126](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/126))

## [0.11.5] - 2026-06-18

### Security
- Deny restricted directories (`.git`, `.obsidian`, `node_modules`) at any depth, not just the vault root. Nested copies were traversable, exposing nested `.git/config` / `.obsidian` contents and polluting the tag index with nested `node_modules` ([#128](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/128), [GHSA-9c83-rr99-vfwj](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/security/advisories/GHSA-9c83-rr99-vfwj))

### Fixed
- `write_note` / `update_frontmatter` no longer misreport unrelated errors as "No space left on device": write errors are now classified by Node error code, not message substring ([#109](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/109))

### Changed
- Dependency updates: `yaml` 2.9.0, `typescript` 6.0.3, dev tooling ([#135](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/pull/135))

## [0.11.4] - 2026-06-17

### Security
- Match the restricted-directory deny-list case-insensitively and canonicalize trailing dots/spaces per path segment. On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), variants like `.Git/config`, `.GIT/config`, or `.git./config` bypassed the `.git`/`.obsidian` restriction ([GHSA-j99q-93c9-h869](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/security/advisories/GHSA-j99q-93c9-h869))

### Changed
- `npm audit fix`: resolved transitive advisories; CI audit gate set to `high`

## [0.11.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- `read_note` / `write_note` (and `patch_note` / `delete_note` / `move_file`) no longer throw an unguarded `TypeError` when `path` is missing; they return a clear "path is required" error ([#107](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/107))

### Note
- First npm release since 0.11.0; also delivers the 0.11.1 and 0.11.2 changes below (AST-aware frontmatter preservation, `delete_note` `trashMode`), which were not separately published.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- `delete_note` now supports soft-delete via `trashMode` parameter ([#91](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/91))
  - `none` (default): permanent delete (previous behavior)
  - `local`: move file to `.trash/` inside the vault, preserving relative folder structure
  - `system`: move file to OS trash/recycle bin via the `trash` package

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Frontmatter updates now use AST-aware YAML preservation. Unmodified fields keep their original formatting, fixing:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` dates being rewritten as full ISO timestamps ([#77](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/77))
  - `HH:MM` values being parsed as YAML 1.1 sexagesimal integers ([#75](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/75))
  - Quoted strings losing their quote style ([#76](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/76))

### Changed
- `update_frontmatter`, `manage_tags`, and `write_note` (append/prepend modes) now preserve raw YAML for unmodified fields via `yaml.parseDocument`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- New `list_all_tags` tool: scans all vault notes for frontmatter tags and inline `#hashtags`, returns deduplicated list sorted by frequency ([#80](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/80))
- Obsidian CLI integration in the skill: preflight checks, command patterns for active file, daily notes, backlinks, and open-in-editor

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- New `createServer(vaultPath, options?)` factory function for library consumers ([#84](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/84))
- `src/index.ts` barrel exports for all public APIs and types
- TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) included in published package
- `exports`, `types` fields in `package.json` for proper ESM library consumption

### Changed
- `server.ts` slimmed to ~60-line CLI entry point, all logic moved to `src/createServer.ts`
- Test files excluded from `dist/` output
- Minimum Node version bumped to 20 (Node 18 EOL)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Symlinks inside the vault that resolve outside the vault boundary are now blocked, closing a path traversal bypass ([#78](https://github.com/bitbonsai/mcpvault/issues/78))
- Circular symlinks (ELOOP) and permission-denied symlink targets (EACCES) return clear error messages
- `list_directory` now includes symlinked files and directories when the target resolves within the vault (previously all symlinks were silently skipped)

### Changed
- Vault root path is now resolved through symlinks at startup for consistent boundary checks
- Dropped Node 18 from CI test matrix (EOL since April 2025, vitest 4.1 requires Node 20+)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Package renamed to `@bitbonsai/mcpvault` on npm at Obsidian's request — update your config by replacing `mcpvault` with `@bitbonsai/mcpvault`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Support for Obsidian first-party note formats: `.base` and `.canvas`
- Optional CLI startup without vault path argument (defaults to current working directory)

### Changed
- Website install/docs refreshed with optional CWD mode guidance and updated release notes

- npm publish metadata cleanup for binary mapping and repository URL consistency

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Token optimization**: New `prettyPrint` parameter for all JSON responses (default: false)
  - Applies to: `read_note`, `search_notes`, `list_directory`, `read_multiple_notes`, `get_notes_info`, `get_frontmatter`
  - Reduces token usage by ~30-40% when disabled

### Changed

  - `excerpt` → `ex`
  - `matchCount` → `mc`
  - `lineNumber` → `ln`
- **Search excerpt**: Reduced context from 50 to 21 characters before/after match
